    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Trash Recycling is a big problem in the United States alone. Every year, millinos of tons of trash is produced, a lot of which is recyclable. We're losing upwards of 75% of recyclables every year, which end up in a landfill rather than being recycled. There's a huge opportunity to minimize waste and reclaim the value of these recyclables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CleanRobotics and TrashBot\n",
    "\n",
    "TrashBot is a family of automated waste sorting bins produced by CleanRobotics. The idea behind TrashBot is to use the latest advances in AI and Computer Vision and Robotics to develop a product that can segregate trash more effectively than humans can. \n",
    "\n",
    "CleanRobotics's current approach involves using single-class image classification to identify the trash items emptied into the TrashBot, and then use the underlying robotics to segregate it automatically. This leads to many problems, chief of which is not being able to do multi-class classification. You're also limited to only being to segregate one item at a time, severely impacting real world performance."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the TrashBot currently works on an image classification model. The first task on the TODO list was to actually create a dataset suitable for object detection tasks. That meant going from per image label to per item bounding boxes and labels for items in each image in the dataset. I started by annotating the required ground truth boxes and class labels, creating an object detection dataset with roughly 8k images and upwards of 10k box annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are 57 categories which make up the approximately 8k images. The range of objects per class if 7 at the lower end and upwards of 1300 at the higher end. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and I'll go into data augmentation and training time transforms below."

    "In its current iteration, the network employed by the TrashBot captures the incoming data, processes it and sends it to the cloud for inference. This has proven to be a performance bottleneck, and the team is planning to move to edge inference to allow for faster decision making. The edge platform that CleanRobotics works on top of is the Google Coral, which is a hardware family built on top of EdgeTPUs designed by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings alongwith it a set of challenges. First off, the model needs to be small enough to fit on the device itself. Secondly, the model needs to be TFLite and EdgeTPU compatible.\n",

    "The EdgeTPU instruction set still doesn't support a lot of the core operations needed to implement a majority of the current state of the art in object detection. It's also restricted to TFLite, leaving Tensorflow as the framework of choice when it comes to development."

    "\n",
    "EfficientNet {% fn 2 %} aims to compound scale the network along multiple dimensions(width, depth and input resolution). Rather than only increasing one dimension at a time, EfficientNet expands the network along all dimensions. The authors use a compound scaling method to autmatically figure out the right scaling parameters, rather than manually turning the scaling coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building from EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",

    "A BiFPN aims to aggregate multi-scale features in a top-down manner. Conventional top-down FPNs are limited by the one way information flow. The authors of PANet added an extra bottom-up aggregation network. This comes at an extra computation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors proposed further optimizations to make bi-directional feature fusion feasible. First, they remove nodes with a single input edge. Secondly, if the input and output node are at the same level, they added an extra edge from input to output node to fuse more features. Thirdly, they repeat the bidirectional path multiple times to allow for better feature fusion. The figure below presents the journey from an FPN to a BiFPN\n",

    "I use a pretrained EfficientNet backbone, trained on MS-COCO. This pretrained model is then used as the feature generator for the object detection task.
