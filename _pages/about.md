I'm a Computer Science Masters grad from SUNY Buffalo, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. During my time at UB, I worked on autonomous vehicles for the [iCAVE2 project](https://icave2.cse.buffalo.edu/index.htm) as well as swarm robotics for the DARPA [OFFSET](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/offensive-swarm-enabled-tactics) Program grant.

I also ran the Deep Learning [student community](https://jsaurabh.github.io/dl-ub) at UB, where we held workshops, tutorials, hackathons and talks on topics as diverse as language modeling to graph neural networks. Most recently, I was awarded the Graduate Entrepreneurship award for building consumer focused products while a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science.

Outside of code, I like building and takings things apart(a screwdriver toolkit was the first thing I ever bought), and have been known to enjoy the odd Star Wars movie marathon.
